## Description
---
This is a console application that simulates the AirBnB Clone (AirBnB Clone is a popular online booking agency for renting homes in any locale)

This is the first step towards building your first full web application: the AirBnB clone. This first step is very important because you will use what you build during this project with all other following projects: HTML/CSS templating, database storage, API, front-end integrationâ€¦

## The Console
---
This is a bit like the previous Shell project but limited to a specific use-case. In this case, we want to be able to manage the objects of our projects

*   Create a new object (ex: a new User or a new Place)
*   Retrieve an object from a file, a database etc...
*   Do operations on objects (count, compute stats, etc...)
*   Update attributes of an object
*   Destroy an object
